 				<p>I teach art classes to all ages and make my own artworks, primarily mixed media pieces. My formal training has been in crafts and design. In addition I am currently studying glass at Sheridan College as a full-time student. Almost Human is a continuous body of work that is a lens through which I portray my experiences and relationships.</p>
